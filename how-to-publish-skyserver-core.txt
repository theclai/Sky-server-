HOW TO PUBLISH SKYSERVER CORE:

1. This assumes that you have a version of the project working: it builds in VS2019 (Shift-Ctrl-B) and you can run it in VS2019 (F5)
2. In the VS2019 menus, go to Build -> Publish
3. Choose the following settings:
   a. Publish Method = File System
   b. Target location = (navigate through your project tree to bin\Debug\netcoreapp2.2\publish\)
   c. Click on Settings in the left-hand menu list
   d. Configuration = Debug
   e. Target Framework = netcoreapp2.2
   f. Deployment Mode = Self-Contained
   g. Target Runtime = win-x86
4. Click Save
5. Click Publish
6. Navigate into the directory SkyServerCore/bin/Debug/netcoreapp2.2/publish/
7. Open web.config
8. There is currently a line that says:

<aspNetCore processPath=".\SkyserverCore.exe" stdoutLogEnabled="false" stdoutLogFile=".\logs\stdout" />

change it to this:

      <aspNetCore processPath=".\SkyserverCore.exe" stdoutLogEnabled="true" stdoutLogFile=".\logs\stdout">
        <environmentVariables>
          <environmentVariable name="ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT" value="Development" />
        </environmentVariables>
      </aspNetCore>

9. If you have already created a website through IIS on scidev02, skip to step 15. If not...
10. If you haven't already created a site, do so now - from the Windows Start Menu, open Internet Information Services (IIS)
11. Navigate to Sites -> Default Web Site
12. Right click, select "Add Application"
13. Done! Load website in browser.
14. Enter an Alias, browse for the right physical path, select "CoreApp" for Application pool, click OK.
15. Go to a machine OUTSIDE of scidev02 and load your site in a browser.
16. Verify that the site is working the way it should. Now it's time to move the site to preprod on skytest.
17. Copy the entire publish directory into your file system (e.g. on tenacious/raddick)
18. Remote desktop into skytest.pha.jhu.edu
Go to \\skytest\preprod.skyserver.sdss.org\current\SkyServerCore\bin\debug\netcoreapp2.2
19. Rename the current publish directory with the date and hash of the last git checkout it includes
20. MOVE (not copy!) today's publish directory from your filesystem space into this directory so it becomes the new publish directory
21. Go here, and everything should work: http://test.preprod.skyserver.sdss.org/skyserver-new
